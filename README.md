# simple-banking-system-hyperskill-project

Hi there. Dimitri here!
This is myy 10th project on hyperskill education web. It calls "Simple Banking System".
I've learned how to handle database SQLite, how to connect it, to change data, to delete and create new tables.
So, this light program allows you to simulate 16 numerical bank card number following Luh algorithm rule, with pincode. Thus create 
your account in system ("Bank", SQL table). Also you are able to send money that you have on your balance!
